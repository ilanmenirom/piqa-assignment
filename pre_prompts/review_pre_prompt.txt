I will give you a question or sentence to complete and two possible answers, and then I will provide a possible answer. The answer is either A, B or NONE, depending on which answer is better. The answer may include an explanation as well. Please review the answer I provided, and then answer the question again. You may write down your reasoning but please write your final answer (either A or B) between the <answer> and </answer> tags
